      <h4><b><u>Why I Chose This Project</u>:</b></h4>
      <p>Not only do I love music, but I've played piano ever since I was five years old. It's one of my favorite hobbies. So when I was thinking of ideas for my final project, a piano was one of the first things I brainstormed. I talked with Nathan, Victoria, and Rob, and I was thrilled when they all told me my idea was plausible. I originally wanted to just have the keys press down on some buttons, but I soon realized that would be too tedious and not really display how much I've learned throughout this course. So I decided to use copper tape to sense touch, which was a significantly better idea. In the end, I'm really glad about how well it turned out. But in the planning phase, I had no idea how much work this piano would really require.</p>

      <h4><b><u>Designing the Components</u>:</b></h4>

      <p>The first part of the process was to design the piano's components in Fusion 360. Below is information about how I designed each component.</p>

      <h5><b>The Keys:</b></h4>
      
      <p>The first thing I did was find <a href = https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17772>this</a> set of piano keys on Thingiverse.</p>
