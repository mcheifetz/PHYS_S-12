  <h3>Final Project Proposal</h3> 

  <div class = "row">
    <div class = "col-sm-12">
      <p>Although I'm not positive on what I want to do for my final project, I was thinking of doing something with piano since I enjoy playing piano. I was mainly thinking about making a makeshift piano and having some way where if you press the key it can electronically play the note. I hope to expand upon this idea or even come up with an entirely better one once I learn more in the class. </p>
