      <p>The assignment for this class was to make and document a kinetic sculpture, integrating an electronic circuit with physical components. I love music and play the piano, so I decided to try and use music in my design. I wanted to do something that was actually plausible, so I stuck to trying to make drums. To do so, I made a circuit consisting of 2 motors with pieces from the board game Mouse Trap attached to the motors that would spin around and hit other pieces from the game, mimicing a drum. I orgininally wanted to glue the pieces to the motors, but, after they didn't stick well enough, I decided to use duct tape to make double sided tape and tape them together. While it's not a perfect solution, it worked well enough. The circuit also utilizes a potentiometer to allow me to slow down and speed up the beats. Pictures and a video of the circut are below: </p>

    <p>Here's the code I used to make the motors spin using the potentiometer. I took Nathan's potentiometer code and editied it slightly to work with 2 motors instead of just 1.</p>

    void loop(){
      int i = 2;
      int j = 3;
