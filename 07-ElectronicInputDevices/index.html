      <p>The first part of the assignment for this class was to use a sensor from the kit to measure a physical quantity with the Arduino. I also had to calibrate the sensor, which means describing the range between its min and max values and whether I can control this range. Lastly, I needed to show data in the form of a table or graph. I chose to use the Hall sensor, like Mr. Hart did, because I wanted to use his demo to get a better understanding of sensors and how they worked. Also, I used a horseshoe magnet from a small kit I had as a little kid magnet, and I wanted to see the difference in results between my magnet and Mr. Hart's. I set up my circuit as seen below: </p>

      <div class = "column2">
        <img src = "./circuit1.png" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "width:100%" height = "250" alt = "circuit1">
      </div>
      <div class = "column2">
        <img src = "./magnet.png" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "width:100%" height = "250" alt = "magnet">
      </div>

      <p>After setting up my circuit, I used the Arduino IDE to code Serial communication that would print the sensor value. When I ran this with no magnet, just the circuit plugged in, the reading was at around 503. The code I used can be seen below:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-arduino">
      void setup() {
        //Initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
        Serial.begin(9600);
      }

      void loop() {
        //Read the input on analog pin 0:
        int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  
        Serial.println(sensorValue);
        delay(10);  // delay in between reads for stability
      }   
      </code></pre>

      <p>I then calibrated the sensor by holding my magnet at various distances and recording my results. Unlike Mr. Hart, who used cardboard as spacers between the magnet and sensor, I used _____. This is the table of values I obtained at different distances away from the sensor:</p>

      <p>The second part of the assignment was to do the same as part 1 but this time with a sensor I fabricated myself. Since my final project is going to be making a piano using copper tape and a buzzer, I wanted to do more than just measure a physical quality, I wanted to actually produce a sound. To do this, I implemented a buzzer and copper tape into my circuit. The result of this circuit can be seen below:</p>
      
      <div class = "column2">
        <img src = "./circuit2.PNG" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "width:100%" height = "250" alt = "circuit2">
      </div>

      <p>After making the circuit, I knew that I would have to add code for the Capacitive sensor (the copper wire) and the buzzer. I read <a href = "https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/08_output/led-buzzers">Nathan's tutorial about buzzers</a> to learn about how the buzzer worked, specifically about producing sound using the tone function. Once I had a better understanding of the buzzer, I produced this code:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-arduino">
      </code></pre>

      <p>The last step was to combine the circuit and code. I did so, and this was the result:</p>
      <div>
        <video controls style = "width:25%; min-width:150px"><source src = "./CopperTapeVideo.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></video>
      </div>
