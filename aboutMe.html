    <div class = "col-sm-12">
      <p>My name is Matt Cheifetz and I'm a rising high school senior from Needham, Massachusetts. I'm a member of the robotics team at my school, in which I work on coding the robot. But I wanted to do more than just learn to code, as I'm really interested in learning how to design and build tools, which is why I signed up for Introduction to Digital Fabrication. I'm really excited to learn a lot and build cool things!</p>
