      <p> The first part of the assignment for the third class was to make a circuit on a breadboard using components from the kit. I made the circuit pictured below, using the two 1k Ω resistors to divide the voltage. I first attached the red wire to the 3.3 V on the microcontroller and connected it to the + on the breadboard, and then I attached the black wire to the GND port and connected it to the - on the breadboard. I then used more wires and two resistors to complete the circuit.</p>

      <p> Once I had this circuit built, I used the multimeter to measure the voltages in the circuit. Before the resistors the voltage was 3.3 V, after the first one it was 1.65 V (half of the starting voltage), and after the second resistor it was 0 V. Once I figured out the voltages, I used Ohm's law to calculate the current in the spot in between the two resistors. Since the voltage was 1.65 V and the resistor was 1000 Ω, the current was 1.65 / 1000, which is 0.00165 A (1.65 mA).</p>

      <p> The next part of the assignment was to simulate my circuit on TinkerCad, which is shown below. I replicated it exactly to make sure it would work. </p>

      <p> The third part of the assignment was to use the Microcontroller Analog in (ADC) using the Arduino software to measure the voltage of a potentiometer in a circuit. The first thing I did was remove the resistors and add in the potentiometer, which would allow me to spin a dial to control the voltage. I connected a yellow wire from the A0 port on the microcontroller to spot in front of the middle leg of the potentiometer, allowing the voltage change to occur. I then opened the AnalogReadSerial Arduino code and altered the print statment to print the actual voltage instead of a number 1-1023. I edited it to this: Serial.println(sensorValue * 3.3) / 1024). Pictures of the new circuit, arduino code, and recorded voltage values can be seen below. </p>
