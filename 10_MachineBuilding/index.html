      <p>The assignment for this class was to make a machine that is controlled from a computer or phone using at least one stepper motor. I decided to make a car using two stepper motors to drive the front wheels. I'm going to split this documentation into four sections because there's a ton of information and troubleshooting that went into this assignment.</p>

      <br>
     
      <h4><b><u>Section 1: Building the Car</u></b></h4>

      <p>The first thing I did was make a circuit consisting of of 2 stepper motors. I used the <a href = "https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/10_machines/machine.html">stepper motor tutorial</a> that our instructors provided to figure out how to wire the motors, and then used a breadboard to run both at the same time. The circuit ended up looking like this:</p>

      <div>
        <img src = "./circuit.png" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "float: left; width: 25%; padding: 5px" height = "350" alt = "circuit">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "col-md-12">
      <p>After setting up the circuit, I moved on to making the wheels. To do so, I used a pair of calipers I found in the storage room of my house to trace four circles of 8 cm diamater on a piece of cardboard. Once I cut the circles out, I made a small hole the center of each with my screwdriver and then pushed two onto the motors to make the hole big enough to work with a motor. I then had to put two wheels onto the stepper motors. To make sure the wheel was straight on the axle, I cut out two small squares of cardboard per wheel and put them on the motor first. I then placed the wheel on top and hot glued it to the axle using the new hot glue gun that I got. The wheels and motors ended up looking like this:</p>

      <div>
        <img src = "./WheelsAndMotors.png" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "float: left; width: 25%; padding: 5px" height = "350" alt = "WheelsAndMotors">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "col-md-12">
      <p>After testing to make sure the wheels spun, I moved on to building the actual car. I first cut out a sheet of cardboard to act as the car body. I then cut out two squares of cardboard for the motors to rest on. I used the hot glue gun to attach the squares to the body, and then did the same for the motors to the squares of cardboard. Once that was all attached, I reached my first major problem: attaching the back wheels in a way that they would actually spin. My first attempt was to hot glue the axle (bbq skewer stick) to the body itself and put glue around the wheels so that they could spin but not move, as there would be glue on either side. The issue with this was that the wheels still had some room between them and the glue, so it was very wobbly, and I had to rethink my idea. The original, failed, back wheels looked like this:</p>

      <div>
        <img src = "./FailedWheels.png" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "float: left; width: 25%; padding: 5px" height = "350" alt = "FailedWheels">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "col-md-12">
      <p>After failing the initial back wheel design, I had to rethink my idea and try again. I decided to make it so that the wheels were stuck on the axle but the axle itself could spin. I used the Lego wheels from our kit and put hot glue in the middle hole. I then stuck the axle into the glue and let it dry so that the axle would stay stuck inside the wheels. Once the wheels were connected, I had to get the axle to stay on the cardboard while still being able to spin. To do so, I made double sided tape but instead of both sides being sticky, both were smooth. However, the top piece was slightly longer, allowing it to stick to the cardboard. That way, there was little room for the axle to move around but it could still spin without flying off. It ended up looking like this:</p>

      <div>
        <img src = "./FailedWheels.png" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "float: left; width: 25%; padding: 5px" height = "350" alt = "FailedWheels">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "col-md-12">
      <p>At this point, I had finished the entire body, and it was time to move on to programming my car.</p>
