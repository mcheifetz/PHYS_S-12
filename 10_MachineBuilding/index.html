      <p>The assignment for this class was to make a machine that is controlled from a computer or phone using at least one stepper motor. I decided to make a car using two stepper motors to drive the front wheels. I'm going to split this documentation into three sections because there's a ton of information and troubleshooting that went into this assignment.</p>

      <br>
      <h3><b><u>Section 1: Building the Car</u></b></h3>
      <p>The first thing I did was make a circuit consisting of of 2 stepper motors. I used the <a href = "https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/10_machines/machine.html">stepper motor tutorial</a> that our instructors provided to figure out how to wire the motors, and then used a breadboard to run both at the same time. The circuit ended up looking like this:</p>

      <div>
        <img src = "./circuit.png" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "float: left; width: 25%; padding: 5px" height = "350" alt = "circuit">
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "col-md-12">
      <p>After setting up the circuit, I moved on to making the wheels. To do so, I used a pair of calipers I found in the storage room of my house to trace four circles of 8 cm diamater on a piece of cardboard. Once I cut the circles out, I made a small hole the center of each with my screwdriver and then pushed two onto the motors to make the hole big enough to work with a motor. I then had to put two wheels onto the stepper motors. To make sure the wheel was straight on the axle, I cut out two small squares of cardboard per wheel and put them on the motor first. I then placed the wheel on top and hot glued it to the axle using the new hot glue gun that I got. The wheels and motors ended up looking like this:</p>
