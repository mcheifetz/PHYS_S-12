      <p>The first part of the assignment for this class was to program a microcontroller to produce an output using at least one button for input while including a conditional statement and a for loop. We had worked with using a button to dim LED's in breakout rooms the previous day, so I decided to expand upon that and give it my own twist. I decided to have one LED performing a task if the button wasn't pressed, and the other LED performing a task if the button was pressed. I ended up programming the LED's so that, if the button was pressed, a red LED would brighten over 2.5 seconds and then dim over 2.5 seconds. Otherwise, a green LED would dim over 2.5 seconds. The code for this can be seen below. </p>
      <pre><code class="language-arduino">
      void loop() {
        // read the state of the pushbutton value:
        buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  
        // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
        if (buttonState == HIGH) {
          // If the button is pressed, brighten the second (red) LED over 2.5 seconds then dim it over 2.5 seconds
          for (int i = 0; i <= 250; i+= 1) {
            analogWrite(PWMpin1, i);  //Second LED gets brighter
            delay(10);
          }

          for (int i = 250; i >= 0; i-= 1) {
            analogWrite(PWMpin1, i);  //First LED gets brighter
            delay(10);
          }  
        } 
        
        // If the button isn't pressed, dim the first (green) LED over 2.5 seconds
        else {
          for (int i = 250; i >= 0; i-= 1) {
            analogWrite(PWMpin2, i);  //First LED gets brighter
            delay(10);
          }       
        }
      }
      </code></pre>

      <p>The result of this code and the circuit looked like this:</p>
      <div>
        <video controls style = "width:50%; height:50%; min-width:300px"><source src = "./LEDVideo.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></video>
      </div>

      <br>

      <p>The second part of the assignment was to find a tutorial for making 3D objects in Fusion360 and create a simple 3D model. I watched a tutorial about <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0bhdr84FNU>designing a 3D printed enclosure for the Arduino Uno</a> and another about <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnKBSOulwo&feature=youtu.be&list=PLmA_xUT-8UlL23teEbhgeU4-3FE8pprpK>designing a 3D printed lampshade</a>. To make sure I had a good grasp on the concepts and tools, I followed along with the lampshade tutorial. Throughout the tutorial, I learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to use the spline tool to make curved lines</li>
        <li>How to use the revolve tool to rotate a sketch around an axis. In this case, it was rotating the general shape for the outside of the lampshade around the y-axis to create the full lampshade shape.</li>
        <li>How to use the offset plane and split body tools to separate different parts of the lampshade and only apply a specific design to the necessary sections</li>
        <li>How to use extrude (to) to extrude to a certain surface instead of a set amount, helpful for cutting holes as deep as a specific section of a body</li>
        <li>How to use the project tool to create the exact dimensions of a body in a new sketch</li>
        <li>How to use 'Edit Feature' on the bottom timeline to edit certain steps of the design</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I really like how the finished design turned out. It looked like this:</p>
      <div class = "column3">
        <img src = "./Lampshade.PNG" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "width:100%" height = "600" alt = "Lampshade">
      </div>

      <br>

      <p>The third and final part of this assignment was to think about our final project, specifically about anyadditional components I'll need. For my final project, I'm making a piano that uses copper wire to play each note. I found a set of keys on Thingiverse that I'm going to 3D print, but there's a hole in each key. In Fusion 360, I modeled a rod to go through the keyboard to keep each key together. It looks like this</p>
      <div class = "column3">
        <img src = "./PianoKeysFusion360.PNG" class = "img-responsive margin" style = "width:100%" height = "600" alt = "Keys">
      </div>
