      <p>The first part of the assignment for this class was to program a microcontroller to produce an output using at least one button for input while including a conditional statement and a for loop. We had worked with using a button to dim LED's in breakout rooms the previous day, so I decided to expand upon that and give it my own twist. I decided to have one LED performing a task if the button wasn't pressed, and the other LED performing a task if the button was pressed. I ended up programming the LED's so that, if the button was pressed, a red LED would brighten over 2.5 seconds and then dim over 2.5 seconds. Otherwise, a green LED would dim over 2.5 seconds. The code for this can be seen below. </p>
      <pre><code class="language-arduino">
      void loop() {
        // read the state of the pushbutton value:
        buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  
        // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
        if (buttonState == HIGH) {
          // If the button is pressed, brighten the second (red) LED over 2.5 seconds then dim it over 2.5 seconds
          for (int i = 0; i <= 250; i+= 1) {
            analogWrite(PWMpin1, i);  //Second LED gets brighter
            delay(10);
          }

          for (int i = 250; i >= 0; i-= 1) {
            analogWrite(PWMpin1, i);  //First LED gets brighter
            delay(10);
          }  
        } 
        
        // If the button isn't pressed, dim the first (green) LED over 2.5 seconds
        else {
          for (int i = 250; i >= 0; i-= 1) {
            analogWrite(PWMpin2, i);  //First LED gets brighter
            delay(10);
          }       
        }
      }

      <p>The result of this code and the circuit looked like this:</p>
